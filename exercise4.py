# Given the variable x and the variable y which have been set for you, write the following

# Print the value of x multiplied by y
# Print the value of the output of step 1 divided by 1.5
# Print the value of the output of step 2 plus by 20
# Print the value of the output of step 3 minus 10
x = 10
y = 5
print(x,y)
step1 = x * y
step2 = step1 / 1.5
step3 = step2 + 20
step4 = step3 - 10
print(step1)
print(step2)
print(step3)
print(step4)
